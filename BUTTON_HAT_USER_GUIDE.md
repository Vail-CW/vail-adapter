## How to Adjust Speed (WPM)

Speed controls how fast your keyer sends code, from 5 WPM (slow) to 40 WPM (fast).

**Step by step:**

1. **Hold Button 1** for 2 seconds
   - When you hear "SPEED" in Morse, release the button

2. **Adjust the speed:**
   - **Button 1** (quick press) = Increase speed by 1 WPM
   - **Button 3** (quick press) = Decrease speed by 1 WPM
   - Each adjustment plays a beep (higher pitch for increase, lower for decrease)
   - **Try it out!** Use your paddle to test the new speed

3. **When you hit the limits:**
   - Minimum is 5 WPM, maximum is 40 WPM
   - If you try to go beyond, you'll hear a low buzz error tone

4. **Save your new speed:**
   - **Hold Button 2** for 2 seconds
   - When you hear "RR" in Morse, release the button
   - You're back to normal mode with your new speed saved!

**OR** just wait 30 seconds - it will auto-save and you'll hear descending tones.

## How to Adjust Tone (Sidetone Frequency)

Tone controls the pitch of your sidetone when keying.

**Step by step:**

1. **Hold Button 2** for 2 seconds
   - When you hear "TONE" in Morse, release the button

2. **Adjust the tone:**
   - **Button 1** (quick press) = Higher pitch
   - **Button 3** (quick press) = Lower pitch
   - Each adjustment plays a 100ms beep at the NEW frequency
   - **Try it out!** Use your paddle to hear the new tone

3. **When you hit the limits:**
   - There are 42 different tones available (middle range of frequencies)
   - If you try to go beyond either end, you'll hear a low buzz error tone

4. **Save your new tone:**
   - **Hold Button 2** for 2 seconds
   - When you hear "RR" in Morse, release the button
   - You're back to normal mode with your new tone saved!

**OR** just wait 30 seconds - it will auto-save and you'll hear descending tones.

## How to Change Key Type

Key type controls how your paddle input is processed.

**The three key types:**
- **Straight (S)** - Acts like a straight key, no automatic timing
- **Iambic A (IA)** - Automatic alternating dits and dahs
- **Iambic B (IB)** - Like Iambic A with squeeze timing (most popular!)

**Step by step:**

1. **Hold Button 3** for 2 seconds
   - When you hear "KEY" in Morse, release the button

2. **Cycle through key types:**
   - **Button 1** (quick press) = Next type forward
   - **Button 3** (quick press) = Previous type backward
   - You'll hear the type identifier in Morse:
     - **S** = ... (dit dit dit) for Straight
     - **IA** = .. .- (I then A) for Iambic A
     - **IB** = .. -... (I then B) for Iambic B
   - **Try it out!** Use your paddle to test the keyer behavior

3. **Cycling order:**
   - Forward: Straight → Iambic A → Iambic B → Straight...
   - Backward: Straight → Iambic B → Iambic A → Straight...

4. **Save your key type:**
   - **Hold Button 2** for 2 seconds
   - When you hear "RR" in Morse, release the button
   - You're back to normal mode with your new key type saved!

**OR** just wait 30 seconds - it will auto-save and you'll hear descending tones.

## CW Memory - Record and Playback

Your Vail Adapter has **three memory slots** that can store CW sequences up to 25 seconds each. You can record your own CQ, contest exchanges, or any other frequently-used messages!

### Memory Management Mode

To work with memories, you first need to enter Memory Management Mode:

1. **Hold Buttons 1+3 together** for 2 seconds
   - When you hear "MEM" in Morse, release the buttons
   - You're now in Memory Management Mode

2. **In this mode:**
   - **Single-click** any button (1, 2, or 3) = Play that memory via piezo only
   - **Double-click** any button (1, 2, or 3) = Start recording to that slot
   - **Long-press** any button (1, 2, or 3) = Clear that memory slot

3. **Exit Memory Management Mode:**
   - **Hold Buttons 1+3 together** again for 2 seconds
   - Or wait 30 seconds for auto-exit

### Recording to a Memory Slot

**Step by step:**

1. **Enter Memory Management Mode** (hold Buttons 1+3)

2. **Double-click** the button for your desired slot:
   - Button 1 = Memory Slot 1
   - Button 2 = Memory Slot 2
   - Button 3 = Memory Slot 3

3. **Listen for the countdown:** "doot, doot, dah" (3 beeps)

4. **Send your CW** using your paddle or straight key
   - Recording starts immediately after the countdown
   - You'll hear the sidetone as you key
   - **Note:** Only the timing is recorded - NO MIDI/keyboard/radio output during recording
   - Maximum recording time: 25 seconds

5. **Stop recording:**
   - **Single-click** the same button you used to start
   - You'll hear two confirmation beeps
   - Recording is automatically saved to EEPROM
   - You're back in Memory Management Mode

**Auto-stop:** If you reach 25 seconds, recording stops automatically with three beeps (low, high, high).

### Playing Back a Memory

There are two ways to play back a memory:

#### Playback in Memory Management Mode (Piezo Only)

1. **Enter Memory Management Mode** (hold Buttons 1+3)
2. **Single-click** the button for the memory you want to hear (1, 2, or 3)
3. Playback through the piezo buzzer only - perfect for previewing!

#### Playback in Normal Mode (via Current Output)

1. **Exit Memory Management Mode** (or don't enter it)
2. **Single-click** the button for the memory you want to send (1, 2, or 3)
3. Playback goes through your **current output mode**:
   - Keyboard mode → Sends keystrokes to computer
   - MIDI mode → Sends MIDI notes
   - Radio mode → Keys your radio output pins
   - **Plus** piezo sidetone (if buzzer enabled)

This is perfect for sending CQ or contest exchanges hands-free!

### Clearing a Memory Slot

1. **Enter Memory Management Mode** (hold Buttons 1+3)
2. **Long-press** the button for the slot you want to clear (2 seconds)
3. You'll hear the memory number followed by "CLR" in Morse
4. That memory slot is now empty

### Memory Slot Quick Reference

| Button | Memory Slot | What It Stores |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| **Button 1** | Slot 1 | Up to 25 seconds of CW timing |
| **Button 2** | Slot 2 | Up to 25 seconds of CW timing |
| **Button 3** | Slot 3 | Up to 25 seconds of CW timing |

### Memory Tips

**Recording Quality:**
- Your recordings capture the **exact timing** of your keying
- All keyer features work during recording (iambic squeeze, etc.)
- The recording is trimmed to remove trailing silence

**Persistence:**
- All three memory slots are saved to EEPROM
- They survive power cycles
- Each slot is independent

**Testing Your Recording:**
- After recording, single-click the same button to preview via piezo
- If you don't like it, just double-click to record over it
- Or long-press to clear and start fresh

**Field Use:**
- Record your CQ at home
- In the field, just single-click to send it via radio/MIDI/keyboard
- No computer needed!

## Tips & Tricks

### Testing While Adjusting
Unlike other CW devices, you can **test while you adjust**:
- In Speed Mode: Key with your paddle to hear the new speed
- In Tone Mode: Key with your paddle to hear the new tone
- In Key Type Mode: Key with your paddle to test the keyer behavior

Changes take effect immediately, so you can find the perfect setting before saving!

### Activity Timeout
The 30-second auto-save timer resets whenever you:
- Press any button
- Use your paddle or straight key

So feel free to take your time testing different settings!

### What Gets Saved
All three settings are saved to EEPROM and survive power cycles:
- Your speed (WPM)
- Your tone (frequency)
- Your key type (Straight/Iambic A/Iambic B)

### Starting From Scratch
If you ever want to know your current settings:
- Enter each mode (the announcement plays at your current setting)
- Speed: Watch the serial monitor for "Current speed: XX WPM"
- Tone: Watch for "Current tone: MIDI note XX (XXX Hz)"
- Key Type: Watch for "Current keyer type: [name]"

### No Computer Needed
Once you're comfortable with the buttons, you can adjust all three settings without ever connecting to a computer. Perfect for field operations or portable setups!

## Troubleshooting

**Problem:** Buttons don't seem to respond
- Make sure you're holding long enough (2 seconds for mode entry)
- Wait for the audio announcement before releasing
- Try a single button at a time first

**Problem:** I'm not hearing any audio feedback
- Check that your piezo buzzer is connected
- Verify you haven't disabled the buzzer (hold DIT for 5 seconds re-enables it)

**Problem:** Settings don't save
- Make sure you either hold Button 2 for "RR" confirmation
- Or wait for the descending tones (30-second auto-save)
- If you exit accidentally (power loss), changes are NOT saved

**Problem:** I don't know which mode I'm in
- Just wait - if you don't press anything for 30 seconds, you'll auto-exit
- Or try entering a mode - you can always save without changing anything

**Problem:** Speed or tone is at the wrong limit
- Press the opposite button to move away from the limit
- Speed range: 5-40 WPM
- Tone range: MIDI notes 43-85 (42 different tones)

## Default Settings

When you first flash the firmware or reset EEPROM:
- **Speed:** 12 WPM
- **Tone:** MIDI note 69 (440 Hz - concert A)
- **Key Type:** Iambic B
