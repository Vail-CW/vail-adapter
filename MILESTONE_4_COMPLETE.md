# Milestone 4: View Logs (On-Device) - COMPLETE

**Completed:** 2025-10-28

## Summary

Successfully implemented on-device QSO log viewing with list and detail views. Users can now browse and view all saved QSO logs directly on the LCD screen.

## Features Implemented

### 1. List View
- Scrollable list of all saved QSOs
- Shows date (MM/DD), time, callsign (large cyan text), band, and mode
- Up to 6 items visible at once with scroll indicators
- Selected item highlighted with cyan border and dark blue background
- Total QSO count displayed in header
- "No logs found" message when empty

### 2. Detail View
- Large callsign display at top
- All logged fields formatted nicely:
  - Date formatted as YYYY-MM-DD
  - Time formatted as HH:MM UTC
  - Frequency with band
  - Mode, RST sent/received
  - Notes with word wrapping
- ESC to return to list view

### 3. Smart Loading
- Dynamically loads QSOs from all daily log files
- Allocates memory only for loaded QSOs
- Properly frees memory on exit (no leaks)
- Handles multiple daily log files automatically

### 4. Navigation
- **List view:**
  - UP/DOWN: Scroll through QSOs
  - ENTER: View full details
  - ESC: Return to QSO Logger menu
- **Detail view:**
  - ESC: Return to list view

## Files Created

- **qso_logger_view.h** (~450 lines)
  - Complete viewing system with list and detail modes
  - Memory management for QSO loading
  - Two-mode state machine (VIEW_MODE_LIST, VIEW_MODE_DETAIL)

## Files Modified

- **menu_navigation.h**
  - Added `startViewLogs()` and `handleViewLogsInput()` forward declarations
  - Wired up MODE_QSO_VIEW_LOGS to call proper handlers
  - Added input routing for view mode

- **vail-summit.ino**
  - Added `#include "qso_logger_view.h"`

## Issues Fixed

### 1. QSO struct field name mismatch
- **Error:** `'struct QSO' has no member named 'time'`
- **Fix:** Changed to `time_on` to match QSO struct definition
- **Location:** qso_logger_view.h lines 147, 247, 346-353

### 2. COLOR_MENU_HEADER undefined
- **Error:** `'COLOR_MENU_HEADER' was not declared in this scope`
- **Fix:** Replaced with `0x1082` (dark blue) used throughout codebase
- **Location:** qso_logger_view.h lines 177, 300

### 3. JSON key mismatch
- **Issue:** Viewer looked for "qsos" key, but storage uses "logs" key
- **Symptom:** "Total QSOs found: 0" despite having saved logs
- **Fix:** Changed `doc.containsKey("qsos")` to `doc.containsKey("logs")` in both counting and loading loops
- **Location:** qso_logger_view.h lines 116, 170
- **Debug output revealed:** Files contain `{"logs":[...]}` not `{"qsos":[...]}`

### 4. SPIFFS filename handling
- **Issue:** `file.name()` returns full path on SPIFFS
- **Fix:** Extract basename from path before `startsWith()` check
- **Location:** qso_logger_view.h lines 86-90, 145-149

## Testing Checklist

All tests passed:

- ✅ View Logs menu item accessible from QSO Logger menu
- ✅ List view shows all saved QSOs (3 QSOs in test)
- ✅ QSO information displayed correctly (date, time, callsign, band, mode)
- ✅ Scrolling works with UP/DOWN arrows
- ✅ ENTER opens detail view with complete QSO information
- ✅ ESC navigation: Detail → List → QSO Logger menu
- ✅ Memory properly allocated and freed (no leaks)
- ✅ Multiple daily log files loaded correctly
- ✅ Empty state shows "No logs found" message

## Serial Debug Output (Success)

```

## Technical Notes

### Memory Management
- QSO array dynamically allocated based on total count
- `new QSO[totalCount]` on entry
- `delete[] viewState.qsos` on exit
- `viewState.qsos = nullptr` prevents double-free

### File Iteration Pattern
- First pass: Count total QSOs across all files
- Second pass: Allocate memory and load all QSOs
- Handles multiple daily log files seamlessly

### UI Design
- Matches existing VAIL SUMMIT card-based design
- Dark blue (0x1082) for headers and selected items
- Cyan highlights for interactive elements
- Gray text for secondary information (time)
- Large callsign display in detail view for readability

## Next Steps

With Milestone 4 complete, the next priorities are:

**Milestone 5: Statistics Dashboard** (2-3 hours)
- Total QSOs count
- QSOs per band breakdown
- QSOs per mode breakdown
- Most active dates
- Unique callsigns worked

**Milestone 6: Export Logs** (3-4 hours)
- ADIF export format
- Save to SPIFFS as .adi file
- File download via web interface (future)

**Milestone 7: Web Interface Foundation** (4-6 hours)
- HTTP server setup
- REST API endpoints
- Static HTML/CSS/JS serving

Choose the next milestone based on priority!
